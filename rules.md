## Game Rules
The following rules are costum/variant rules that will be used during the game.

### Bonus Action as Action
You can use your *action* to perform a second *bonus action* during your turn. However, you cannot perform the same *bonus action* twice on your turn.

### Brutal Critical
When you deal a critical hit to a creature, you damage is the max value of all your damage dice + rolling the dice once + any other modifiers, instead of rolling all  twice.

### Countering a Spell
When using your reaction to indentify a spell, you may use the same reaction to cast [*Counterspell*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Counterspell#content) if you wish do so.

### Knocking a Creature Unconsious
When reducing a creature's hit points to 0 with a melee attack, you can choose to knock the creature unconsious instead of killing it. In order to do this the performed attack must be able to create this result. You must also be able to explain how you do this (this explaination doesn't need to be complex, but creativity can be rewarded. One could, for example, hit a creature with the blunt side of the their sword on the final blow).

### Mixing Potions [DMG 140]
Mixin potions can be very dangerous. When under the effects of multiple potions, side effects will occor, potentially unpleasant ones. (Custom *Potion Miscibility* table may apply)

### More Difficult Identifications [DMG 136]
The properties of a magic item can't be identified by spending a short rest with it, one must spend time experimenting with the item or use other means like the [*Identify*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Identify#content) spell.

### Risky Stabilizations
When performing a *Wisdom (Medicine)* check to stabilize a creature, the creature gains 1 death save failure when the check fails.

### Scrolls for Everyone
Eny creature who can read the language of a *spell scroll* can attempt to cast is, not only casters. If the spell on the scroll is part of your spelllist and of a level you can cast, you can activate the scroll without issue. If the spell is not on your spell list or of a level which you cannot cast, you must succeed on a *DC 10 + spell level Intelligence (Arcana)* check in order to activate the scoll successfully. 

### Scroll Mishaps [DMG 140]
When the activations of a *spell scroll* fails, a mishap may occor of the activator fails a *DC 10 Intelligence saving throw*. (Custom *Scroll Mishap* table may apply)

### Supportive Actions
In order to preform a supportive action (*Help Action*, *Bardic Inspiration*, *Flash of Genius*, …) you must be able to describe how you preform this. This must not always be a complex explanation (but creativity could be rewarded), Bardic Inspiration can simply consist out of some inspiring words… or you can use a help action as someone tries to breach a locked door by simply helping them push.

### Using a Potion
You can drink a potion as a bonus action, or administor it to a willing creature as an action.
